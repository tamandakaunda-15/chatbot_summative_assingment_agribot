AGRICULTURE_CONTEXT = """
Soil degradation is a serious problem in agriculture. It leads to reduced crop yields and desertification.
The two main forms of soil degradation are Physical degradation and Chemical degradation.
In physical degradation, the physical characteristics of soil are interfered with, such as by compaction or erosion, 
which reduces water infiltration and root penetration.
In chemical degradation, the chemical composition of soil is altered, such as by salinization (salt buildup) 
or nutrient depletion, which affects soil fertility.
Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons. 
It improves soil health, optimizes nutrients in the soil, and combats pest and weed pressure.
Common pests in Malawi agriculture include the African Armyworm and Red Spider Mites. 
Control measures often involve integrated pest management (IPM) which combines biological, cultural, and chemical controls.
